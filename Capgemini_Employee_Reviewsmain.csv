One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards. Adequate compensation is essential for employees to maintain a sustainable livelihood and stay motivated in their roles.
Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.
Some FS accounts not aligning with intended roles (Development / Testing), hindering technical growth and expertise.

One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards. Adequate compensation is essential for employees to maintain a sustainable livelihood and stay motivated in their roles.
Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.
Some FS accounts not aligning with intended roles (Development / Testing), hindering technical growth and expertise.

One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards. Adequate compensation is essential for employees to maintain a sustainable livelihood and stay motivated in their roles.
Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.
Some FS accounts not aligning with intended roles (Development / Testing), hindering technical growth and expertise.

One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards.

Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.

One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards.

Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.

One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards. Adequate compensation is essential for employees to maintain a sustainable livelihood and stay motivated in their roles.
Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.

Management Consultant,,,Positive,5,"First let me start by the biggest thing positive about this organization. I joined when times were turbulent, Clients were firing contractors due to Corona from left or right. Obviously for any service providing company this is a challenge to payout for their vast number of employees without getting revenues from Business. In came Mr. Aiman Ezzat with a announcement saying none of the recent hires or existing employees would be asked to let go. I stayed without any assignments for 7 months, got confirmed and eventually in the month of December I finally found my first assignment, had this been any other employer, I would have been anxious in the last bone of my body. 
Not only I successfully spent the next 17 months working for Capgemini India, I eventually got nominated for my first ever Long-term onsite opportunity to work for Insights & Data Netherlands though a pilot program called Destination Abroad. And from what I know I am not alone, there are 19 more candidates from all over India who got selected only for NL, Sweden I don't even know how many.
Now to be said this is overkill, let me give you more, I spent countless hours taking interview for I&D India, for which I was given extra allowance. Since the onset of Corona I didn't went to Capgemini office a single day except for completing my India Transfer formalities. I was able to see my newly-born daughter grow in front of my eyes, without loosing respect with my peers, both in Capgemini and Client, got an onsite opportunity and promotion with hike at the same time. What else could a 38 year old father ask for, who might get a mid-life crisis in this corona situation....Read More","Okay, the only thing I would say that might turn many people off is the lack of a salary hike, even though you are a better performer than the rest. I was rated 2nd best this year, but since I got a no promotion too I couldn't comprehend the salary hike due to my rating. But from what I have heard from colleagues around is that its less than the inflation rates in India. But consider the fact that the organization had a working hybrid model for work location even before Corona, you might eventually get on with it, until a time comes when it starts pinching you. For me it never came within the 2.2 years and might not come in the near future also, but yeah that's the point....Read More"

Senior Consultant & Senior Technical Writer,Content Management (Print / Online / Electronic) Department,Full Time,Negative,1,"One of the terrible places to work. The senior management converts your performance rating from 1 to 3 citing the company has no money to pay for the appraisal. Amazing toxic workplace culture. There are hundreds of courses to do but your managers will neither guide you for it, nor they ever talk about their existence. And the most amazing department is the HR department. You will need an exclusive hotline to reach them. They live on a different planet and mood zone it seems. You need to write a mail and keep a director-level senior person to get the things done. Keep it up, Capgemini. Your awards are good on papers that you win. There is zero on ground level that is seen and felt by the employees....Read More","NO motivation. Threats. No weekends if targets are not reached. Worst appraisal systems and hikes. If you want to change the horrible project managements after years, you will be made a football between two horrible project management managers.  All the best to join Capgemini."
