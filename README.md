# Employee-Sentiment-Analysis
In today’s competitive business landscape, understanding employee sentiment is vital for fostering a productive work environment and improving retention. This study explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze employee feedback collected from Capgemini’s open-source employee reviews. The primary objective is to extract actionable insights from qualitative data by leveraging both machine learning and deep learning approaches. The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and vectorization using TF-IDF and Word2Vec. Sentiment analysis was performed using the VADER tool and label encoding, classifying sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Three supervised machine learning models—Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest were implemented, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 95%. Deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Bidirectional LSTM, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were also employed, with CNN achieving an 86.64% accuracy. The findings highlight that employees expressed more positive sentiments, primarily appreciating work-life balance and job security, while concerns were raised over management and salary. The study concludes that NLP-based sentiment analysis provides a powerful framework for organizations to systematically interpret employee feedback and implement informed, data-driven HR strategies. Future work should consider real-time sentiment tracking and the integration of broader datasets for enhanced accuracy and applicability.**
