One concern resolves around the average salary for Software and Senior Software Engineers, which appears to be relatively low compared to industry standards. Adequate compensation is essential for employees to maintain a sustainable livelihood and stay motivated in their roles.
Additionally, I have observed some discrepancies in the no promotion and appraisal process within certain accounts, including the one I am currently a part of. It seems that no promotions are not solely based on performance but rather appear to be random at times. It would be beneficial for the company to establish a more transparent and merit-based system to recognize and reward employees hard work and achievements.
Favoritism towards employees with strong manager relationships, neglecting technical contributions and undervaluing hardworking employees.
Some FS accounts not aligning with intended roles (Development / Testing), hindering technical growth and expertise.
